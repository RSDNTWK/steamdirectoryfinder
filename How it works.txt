How it works:

The original intention of this mountfix tool is to address a problem where GCF files were replaced in all valve source games known as the steampipe update as well as address the recent 20th anniversary updates.

    Client:
        the program starts by extracting the needed files which are HLLib.dll and HLExtract.exe
         it then continues by running the command "dir /s /b" on each drive in order to locate the mount folders
        once the program finds the folders of the currently installed mounts it stores them in variables
        from here it accesses the folders of each mount and extracts the vpks in the correct order
        then it creates a symlink between the source sdk 2007 folder and the game folder where the vpks have been extracted
        finally it creates the mount file in the mounts folder of OC so that the user does not need to select the mounts themselves

    Server:
         this portion begins by extracting some needed files which are the HLLib.dll, HLExtract.exe, 7za.exe and addons.zip the addons.zip contains a few files that the oc server needs
         next it downloads sourcemod, metamod, and steamcmd directly from thier websites so they did not need to be embeded in the program
         from here it extracts steamcmd.zip into a subfolder named steamcmd
         next it asks the user for the username and password that they wish to use to install the server,
         from here the user clicks the install server button,
         the process then begins downloading all the requested and required content
         once this long process completes the vpks of all the mounts are extracted and then the vpks are deleted. 
         then all unneeded folders are deleted as well
         it then extracts the external ipv4 ip address of the server and writes it to a start.bat file
         finally it extracts the addons.zip folder to the obsidian sourcemods directory so that the basic server will work without much trouble

    Both: 
        once the program completes its duties it cleans up after itself by deleting all extracted and downloaded folders including the steamcmd folder as to prevent the login details of the user from being located.
